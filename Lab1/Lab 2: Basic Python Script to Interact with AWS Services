Lab 2: Basic Python Script to Interact with AWS Services

Introduction to Boto3:
Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python. It allows you to interact with various AWS services programmatically. You can find the official Boto3 documentation here: Boto3 Documentation

AWS SDK and Its Relevance in Automation:
AWS SDKs, including Boto3 for Python, are essential for automating tasks and interacting with AWS services. They provide a convenient way to access AWS resources, manage configurations, and perform various operations programmatically. AWS SDKs are crucial for cloud automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), and building AWS-based applications.

=> Write a Python script using Boto3 to list all your S3 buckets

Task1: Install and configure boto3
	1.1: Install boto3
		Command: pip install boto3
             1.2: Aws Cli  Installation and Configuration
		1.2.1: Aws cli installation:
			Command1: curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"	
Command2: unzip awscliv2.zip
Command3: sudo ./aws/install
1.2.2: aws configure:
	Command1: aws configure(after running this command you would be asked to input your access key and security key along with your default region

Task 2: Write a Python Script to List S3 Buckets
	Create any python file then open it through vim editor or any other editor of you choice, press i to insert elements in it. After that write the below code in the file
import boto3

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List all S3 buckets
response = s3.list_buckets()

print("List of S3 Buckets:")
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(f"- {bucket['Name']}")

After this run python3 YourFilename.py
